Urban Match will now assume its original nature, to become a research lab and start-up builder focused on creating and growing companies dedicated to improving urban development through hardware, software and services. We've successfully refocused our work and concentrated all our services into our first spin-off and greatest creation yet. We call it Placer. Placer as in to place something somewhere, and make a place out of it. Amongst many other new features, our Lisbon Renovation Data Base will now be provided by Placer's Intelligence team through a new tool called Placer App. All customers will keep its access on this new platform.

## Our First Three Years

Our first 3 years were incredible as we got to prove our vision, earn a lot of recognition and triple our revenue every single year. Still, as all young entrepreneurs, we've made a lot of mistakes and had a lot to learn. Since 2013 we've been rebuilding the company, radically reducing over-spending on disperse research & development and focusing on boosting our profitable services with Placer and Expansion Company (a special service from Placer). This strategy couldn't have been more successful and so today not only are we 3 times the size we were, we're also proud to say we're on our feet and fulfilling our destiny.

We would like to thank all of our former employees, our partners, our investors, our clients and of course, our team for the huge confidence, faith and effort that took to make this possible. Behind an amazing company, there are even more amazing people. You'll be hearing from us soon.
